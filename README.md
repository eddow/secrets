# Secrets

## Installation

```
npm i
```
Notes:
- When semantic asks information, the easiest is to just press `enter` several times and keep the default options.
- Mongodb needs to be installed and running on the server. If it runs somewhere else, it can be configured in `srv-prod.yaml`

## Running

```
npm build
npm start
```

Once launched, it can be accessed on http://localhost:4003/create .
